    <h1>AI-Powered Course Management Dashboard<br>90% Executive Presentation Speaker Notes</h1>
    
    <h2>Slide 1: Title Slide</h2>
    <div class="notes jackson-notes">
        <span class="speaker jackson">Jackson:</span>
        <p>"Good afternoon, Professor Brandquist. I'm Jackson Gray, the Project Manager for the AI-Powered Course Management Dashboard team. With me are Jonas Neves, our Technical Lead, and Shaun Donovan, our Documentation and Quality Lead. Today we're presenting our 90% Executive Presentation focusing on our Monitoring and Controlling phase, showcasing the progress we've made since our 60% presentation."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 2: Project Recap</h2>
    <div class="notes jackson-notes">
        <span class="speaker jackson">Jackson:</span>
        <p>"Before diving into our monitoring activities, I'd like to quickly recap our project objectives. We set out to develop a Chrome extension that enhances Canvas with AI capabilities to address key student challenges:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Deadline management and workload organization</li>
            <li>Assignment prioritization assistance</li>
            <li>AI-powered discussion suggestions</li>
            <li>Cross-course progress tracking</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We're now at 90% completion, with our Chrome Extension MVP, API Integration, and UI/UX phases complete. We're currently in the final stages of Beta Testing, which began on March 22nd and will conclude on April 15th. I'll now hand over to Shaun to walk through our monitoring and controlling overview."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 3: Monitoring Overview</h2>
    <div class="notes shaun-notes">
        <span class="speaker shaun">Shaun:</span>
        <p>"As Documentation and Quality Lead, I've been closely involved in our monitoring processes. During Modules 10 and 11, our focus has been on four key areas:</p>
        <p>First, Risk Management, where we've proactively identified and mitigated potential issues. Second, Performance Tracking using Earned Value Management and KPIs. Third, Variance Analysis to assess schedule and cost deviations. And finally, Contingency Planning for unforeseen events.</p>
        <p>Our current status dashboard shows we're slightly behind schedule with a minor delay in beta testing, but we're under budget, have mitigated most identified risks, and our quality metrics are on target. I'll now continue with our risk management activities."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 4: Risk Management</h2>
    <div class="notes shaun-notes">
        <span class="speaker shaun">Shaun:</span>
        <p>"As part of our quality assurance process, I've been tracking our risk management activities. Our current risk matrix shows Canvas API limitations as a medium severity risk that we've successfully mitigated through our caching system, which reduced API calls by 60%.</p>
        <p>Data privacy was identified as our highest severity risk due to FERPA requirements. I'm pleased to report this has been fully mitigated through our compliance audit completed on April 1st.</p>
        <p>We currently have two active risks: Chrome compatibility issues, where we've reduced failure rates to 10%, and potential low user adoption, which we're addressing through our beta testing incentives program. While these risks aren't fully resolved, all of our critical risks have been successfully mitigated. I'll now hand over to Jackson to discuss our Earned Value Management."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 5: Earned Value Management</h2>
    <div class="notes jackson-notes">
        <span class="speaker jackson">Jackson:</span>
        <p>"As Project Manager, I've been tracking our progress using Earned Value Management metrics. As of April 11th, our Planned Value is $147.60, Earned Value is $137.50, and Actual Cost is $95.</p>
        <p>This gives us a Schedule Variance of -$10.10, indicating a minor delay caused by extended UI/UX testing. However, our Cost Variance is +$42.50, showing we're significantly under budget. This translates to a Schedule Performance Index of 0.96 and a Cost Performance Index of 1.32.</p>
        <p>While we're slightly behind schedule, our strong cost performance provides a buffer for any contingencies. We expect to recover our schedule variance by April 15th when beta testing concludes. Now I'll hand over to Shaun to discuss our Key Performance Indicators."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 6: Key Performance Indicators</h2>
    <div class="notes shaun-notes">
        <span class="speaker shaun">Shaun:</span>
        <p>"Our KPIs show we're making excellent progress toward our targets. Task completion stands at 90%, with only beta testing remaining to be completed by April 15th.</p>
        <p>API response time has been optimized to 450ms, well under our 500ms target. This has been a critical performance metric for user experience, ensuring the extension feels responsive.</p>
        <p>Bug resolution time is averaging 18 hours for critical issues, exceeding our 24-hour target. And user engagement is at 85%, approaching our 90% goal. Based on current trends and feedback implementation, we expect to reach all KPI targets by project completion.</p>
        <p>These metrics are actively monitored with daily updates to ensure we maintain this performance through project closure. Jonas will now discuss our contingency planning."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 7: Contingency Planning</h2>
    <div class="notes jonas-notes">
        <span class="speaker jonas">Jonas Neves:</span>
        <p>"We've developed contingency plans for several unforeseen circumstances that could impact project completion. For budget cuts, we have a fallback to free-tier LLMs such as LLaMA, which would allow us to maintain core functionality without API costs.</p>
        <p>For technical team absences, we've implemented cross-training to ensure continuity, which has already proven valuable during team members' travel commitments.</p>
        <p>In case of hardware failures, we've established cloud backups at a minimal cost of $15. And for potential API outages, we've developed an offline mode that allows continued use without immediate data synchronization.</p>
        <p>Our total contingency buffer is $30, representing 18% of the project budget, providing adequate protection against these potential issues."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 8: Technical Demo - Screenshots</h2>
    <div class="notes jonas-notes">
        <span class="speaker jonas">Jonas Neves:</span>
        <p>"I'd like to show you our extension in action. Our beta version was deployed on April 6th, and these are actual screenshots from our functioning prototype.</p>
        <p>The first screenshot shows the assignment details page with AI-powered tips. The extension analyzes assignment descriptions and provides targeted study recommendations, helping students understand key requirements.</p>
        <p>The second screenshot demonstrates our weekly focus dashboard with cross-course assignment tracking and AI-powered prioritization. This feature has been particularly well-received by beta testers, with 85% reporting improved organization.</p>
        <p>All code is available in our GitHub repository, which Professor Brandquist can access for a deeper technical review if desired."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 9: Technical Demo - Features & Feedback</h2>
    <div class="notes jonas-notes">
        <span class="speaker jonas">Jonas Neves:</span>
        <p>"We've successfully implemented two key AI features that form the core of our solution:</p>
        <p>First, our AI-powered assignment insights analyze assignment descriptions to provide contextual study recommendations, helping students focus on the most important aspects of their work.</p>
        <p>Second, the cross-course dashboard centralizes assignments from all courses with intelligent prioritization based on deadlines and complexity.</p>
        <p>Early feedback from beta testers has been overwhelmingly positive. One student noted, 'The AI tips really helped me understand what to focus on for my history quiz. Saved me hours of study time!'</p>
        <p>These real-world validations confirm we're delivering on our project objectives."</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Slide 10: Next Steps & Closure</h2>
    <div class="notes jackson-notes">
        <span class="speaker jackson">Jackson:</span>
        <p>"Looking ahead, we have three remaining milestones:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete beta testing by April 15th, incorporating final user feedback</li>
            <li>Finalize documentation by April 21st, including installation guides and compliance reports</li>
            <li>Deliver our Final Presentation on April 26th</li>
        </ol>
        <p>We want to thank you for your guidance throughout this process, Professor Brandquist. The project was completed and deployed on April 6th, with beta testing and monitoring ongoing. We're on track for full closure by our target date."</p>
