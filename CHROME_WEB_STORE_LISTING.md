## Store Publishing Information

### Single Purpose Description
Canvas On Top is designed for a single purpose: to enhance the Canvas LMS experience by providing students with streamlined task management and prioritization capabilities directly within their existing Canvas workflow, helping them better organize their academic responsibilities.

### Permission Justifications

#### tabs justification
The tabs permission is necessary to detect when a user is on a Canvas LMS page and to enable the extension to open specific Canvas pages when a user interacts with assignments or courses from the extension's interface.

#### sidePanel justification
The sidePanel permission is essential for our core functionality - it creates a dedicated space where users can view all their Canvas assignments across courses in an organized manner without leaving their current Canvas page.

#### storage justification
The storage permission is required to save user preferences, cache Canvas API data locally for offline access, and store prioritization settings to provide a consistent experience between browser sessions.

#### activeTab justification
The activeTab permission is needed to interact with the current Canvas page, allowing the extension to identify the current course context and provide relevant information in the side panel.

#### Host permission justification
Host permission for instructure.com is limited to only "/api/v1/courses/*" which is the minimum scope needed to access assignments, discussions, and course data through the Canvas LMS API. This precise permission scope ensures we only request access to the specific API endpoints required for the extension's core functionality.

The OpenAI API endpoint permission (api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions) is strictly limited to a single endpoint and is only used when users explicitly enable AI features by providing their own API key. No user data is transferred to OpenAI without explicit user consent through providing their own API key. All API communication is done client-side with no intermediate server processing or data retention.

### Remote Code Usage
No, I am not using Remote code. All JavaScript is packaged within the extension. The only external API calls are to the Canvas LMS API (to retrieve user's course data) and optionally to the OpenAI API (if users enable AI features and provide their own API key).
